>Some of us get dipped in flat, some in satin, some in gloss.... But every once in a while you find someone who's iridescent, and when you do, nothing will ever compare.

我多么希望能遇到一个人，告诉她：You are the one nothing will ever compare。

###心灵捕手 Good Will Hunting

Sean与Will在公园里的促膝长谈,Sean讲了下面一段话  

>So, if I asked you about art, you'd probably give me the skinny on Every art book ever written.Michelangelo. You know a lot about him: life's work, political aspirations, him and the Pope, sexual orientation, the whole works, right? But I bet you can't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never actually stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling…seeing that. If I ask you about women, you'll probably give me a syllabus of your personal favorites. You may have even been laid a few times. But you can't tell me what it feels like to wake up next to a woman and feel truly happy. You're a tough kid. And I ask you about war, you'd probably, uh, throw Shakespeare at me, right? "Once more onto the breach, dear friends…But you've never been near one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap…and watched him gasp his last breath, lookin' to you for help. I ask you about love, you'll probably quote me a sonnet. But you've never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable……Known someone that could level you with her eyes……feelin' like God put an angel on earth just for you……who could rescue you from the depths of hell……And you wouldn't know what it's like to be her angel……to have that love for her, be there forever…through anything…through cancer. And you wouldn't know about sleeping sittin' up in a hospital room for two months, holding her hand, because the doctors could see in your eyes that the terms "visiting hours" don't apply to you. You don't know about real loss……'cause that only occurs when you love something more than you love yourself. I doubt you've ever dared to love anybody that much. I look at you.I don't see an intelligent, confident man. I see a cocky, scared-shitless kid. But you're a genius, Will. No one denies that. No one could possibly understand the depths of you. But you presume to know everything about me, because you saw a painting of mine. You ripped my fuckin' life apart. You're an orphan, right? Do you think I know the first thing about how hard your life has been? How you feel? Who you are? Because I read Oliver Twist? Does that encapsulate you?Personally, I don't give a shit about all that. Because you know what? I can't learn anything from you I can't read in some fuckin' book. Unless, you wanna talk about you…who you are. Then I 'm fasciated. I'm in. But you don't want to do that, do you? You're terrified of what you might say.  

这部电影经典的对白很多，篇幅原因就只列这一段话。我们平日的对话通常都是传达信息，甚至打发时间。但是当我们卸下防卫，将对话用于心灵的交流时，我们能够感受到对方的感受，达到一语胜千言的畅快。以前我总觉得自己不善表达，是因为文字功底差。现在我的体会是，只要是发自内心真切的感受，任何表达出来的语句都必将动人。而我恰恰是一个沉浮于世、极少用心去感受的人。我看不见天空，看不见树叶。所以做不到。  

###模仿游戏 The Imitation Game

>-It's about cryptography.   
>-Like secret messages?  
>-Not secret. That's the brilliant part. Messages that anyone can see,but no one knows what they mean unless you have the key.  
>-How's that different from talking?  
>-Talking?  
>-When people talk to each other, they never say what they mean. They say something else,and you're expected to just know what they mean.Only I never do. So, how's that different?  

从广义来说，这整个世界都是加密的，我们听到的，看到的。有的人善于解密，所以他们能通情达理，能洞若明火，甚至能顿悟人生。解密的关键，我觉得就是用心去感受，不懂用心去感受的人，就只能糊涂一世。

###星际穿越 Interstellar

>**Teacher:** Murph is a great kid. She's really bright.But she's been having a little trouble lately.She brought this in to show the students. The section on the lunar landings.  
>**Cooper:** Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.She always loved the pictures.  
>**Teacher:** It's an old federal textbook. We've replaced them with the corrected versions.  
>**Cooper:** Corrected?  
>**Teacher:** Explaining how the Apollo missions were faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union.  
>**Cooper:** You don't believe we went to the moon?  
>**Teacher:** It was a brilliant piece of propaganda.The Soviets bankrupted themselves pouring resources...Into rockets and other useless machines.  
>**Cooper:** "Useless machines."  
>**Teacher:** If we don't want a repeat of the excess and wastefulness of the 20th century, then...we need to teach our kids about this planet, not tales of leaving it.  
>**Cooper:** One of those useless machines they used to make was called an MRI.If we had any of those left, the doctors would've been able to find...the cyst in my wife's brain before she died instead of afterwards.Then she'd have been the one listening to this instead of me...which would have been a good thing, because she was always...the calmer one.  
>**Teacher:** I'm sorry about your wife, Mr. Cooper.But Murph got into a fistfight with several of her classmates over this Apollo nonsense.So we thought it best to bring you in and see what ideas...you might have for dealing with her behavior on the home front.  
>**Cooper:** Yeah, you know what? Um, there's a game tomorrow night.She's going through a bit of a baseball phase.Her favorite team is playing. There's gonna be candy and soda and...I think I'll take her to that.  

虽然是科幻片，但个人非常喜欢的是剧中人物情感的表达，不论是家庭生活的温情脉脉，还是生死离别的感人肺腑。该片没有特别喜欢的台词，但是几乎每一句从马修说出来的对白都喜欢，个人比较喜欢这种幽默。

###少年时代 Boyhood

>-I feel like there's so many things that I could be doing and probably I want to be doing that I'm just not.  
>-Why aren't you?  
>-I mean, I guess it's just being afraid of what people would think.  
>-I guess it's really easy to say like, "I don't care what anyone else thinks", But everyone does. You know?  
>-Exactly.  

该片似乎没有什么跌宕起伏的剧情，就像是日常生活的纪录片一下。随着梅森的渐渐长大，我作为一个观众，感觉像是和他一起长大了一样。那些他经历的事情，就像是我也经历了一遍。
